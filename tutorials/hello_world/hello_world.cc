   * The `rt.shutdown(e)` function is used to trigger the shutdown process. It takes an
   * event `e` as a precondition, meaning the runtime will only shut down once this event
   * has completed. In our case, this event represents the completion of the MAIN_TASK or
   * all HELLO_TASKs.
   *
   * The `rt.wait_for_shutdown()` function is necessary to ensure that all processes
   * remain synchronized and do not exit prematurely before the runtime fully shuts down.
   *
   * If collective spawning (`rt.collective_spawn()`) is used, then shutdown must be
   * called on all processes with the same event to ensure consistency.
   *
   * When manually managing task launching without collective_spawn, we ensure only rank 0
   * (the process with `address_space() == 0`) triggers shutdown.
